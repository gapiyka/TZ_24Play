## Survey 

1. How much do you work in Unity and C# in total (in terms of time)?

I have been interested in programming since school, and since then I have had the desire to develop in this field.
In every possible subject I study at university, I try to do labs in C#,
even when the artificial intelligence teacher recommends using python ;)
Of course, in addition to highly specialized subjects, when you need to write something in assembler or use other technology.
In general, I have devoted about two years to Unity, but of course with breaks of "rest" for studying at the university or entertainment.
The first educational project was created in the summer of 2020.


2. How exactly did you learn Unity/C# (self-study, courses (specify which ones), etc.)

- Self-education is a must have. Reading documentation, forums and blogs is an integral part of my learning.
- Youtube - viewing which accelerated the learning of the Unity3D engine. (if you are interested [my selection](https://telegra.ph/Youtube-kanali-pro-GameDev-02-08))
- Courses - of course it may sound cool, but in reality I consider it the least productive method ( [programming course](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/BY6SLB55BJNH) and [crus game design](https: //www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/9HCG58LPLWFG) )
- KPI - in this course at the university, I am studying a subject about game development. It is taught by representatives of the Genesis Kyiv company.


3. How many Unity projects have you developed?
Not only commercial projects are meant, but also projects for independent practice and study.
Write a short description listing the type (2D/3D) and interesting mechanics you used (eg stacking, merge, clicker, puzzle, etc.)
If possible, add a video / source code / link (one thing is possible) of the most interesting projects in your opinion.
